1-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share the files with other people on the internet. When you are working in a group and everyone has to access the files.

2-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes you don't want to share incomplete ideas with other people. The version shared online should be always working.
